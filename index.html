    <p> 
      Today I went to my Amazon job, got my AMZN 
      laptop set up for ruby development, and I worked on 
      a problem set at work, where I mostly read it only 
      (without practicing it).  After work I went to 
      BJ's and the Home Depot.  I arrived home by 
      7:56 pm, and I intend to gather keys for my new 
      customer and look for new key blanks.  I also intend 
      to practice coding.
